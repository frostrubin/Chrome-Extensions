Umlaut Helper
=============

This Extension can be loaded to provide the following features:

- Umlaut Key Combinations (AE => Ä, oe => ö, etc.)
- Eszett Key Combination  (sss => ß)
- Special Key Combo for Euro Sign (CTRL+ALT+e => €)
- Enable/Disable via CTRL+ALT+l 
  Replacement of "mistyped" words (m;glich => möglich, etc.)


The ngerman de_de dictionary was used for the last feature.
You can use create_dict.html/.js to adapt the logic and get a custom dictionary.
